# Node.js Transactions Take Home Task (2 hours limited)

This is an example project for a take home task written with Node.js with a basic Svelte client to show how this works.
It is a good example how transactions work.

The project totally must take only 2 hours. There lot's of improvement points.

## Technologies:
- Node.js (Express)
- Sequelize
- SQLite
- Helmet
- Winston
- Svelte
- Rollup

## How to start
 You should npm install in root and under the client separately (I could add a script for it). Then, you should run `npm run seed` (same thing, beforescript) then `npm run start` will work for client and server.


## My notes
- I can create a generic error&exception handler.
- I can provide lots of unit tests here
- I can use artillery to measure performance and scalability. Since it's sqlite but it could show how I think.
- I can use Joi or related packages to validate my project to have more structural and fail free validation.
- ... lots of things can be added. However in the given time, I could only add these.
